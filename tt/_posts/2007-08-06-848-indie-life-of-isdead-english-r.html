The member were mrkwang: the admin of Pig-Min,
Bluedisk: the famous guy(Some day, I'll make a spin-off series for
him), wings: a girl who works in the 'online game' company, and me.<br /><br /> Also we had very nice conversation about musics, movies, and games all night. This was a nice experience to me, anyway.<br /><br />
However, I had to dish all of dishes, so I'm a bit tired now. That's
the reason why I passed today's strip. Sorry for everyone! =p<br /><br />P.S. : Even this edition has 'Game Reference'. Do you know what it is? :)<br /></font></div></div>
