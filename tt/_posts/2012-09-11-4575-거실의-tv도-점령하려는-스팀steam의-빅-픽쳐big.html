&gt;&gt;&gt; 요구사양이 윈도우 비스타 이상이라 해보지 못했습니다. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>스팀에서 베타를 시작한 새로운 서비스 빅 픽쳐(Big Picture)는, 컴퓨터 모니터보다 훨씬 큰 거실의 TV에서 스팀을 돌릴 수 있다는 서비스입니다. 그동안 현세대 거치형 콘솔들이 노려온 '거실 점령'에 스팀도 한 발을 올렸다고 볼 수 있겠습니다. 현재 베타 서비스를 진행중이고, 스팀 클라이언트에서 설정 -&gt; 계정 -&gt; 베타 참가 -&gt; 변경 -&gt; Steam Beta Update를 선택하면 체험하실 수 있습니다. <br><br>스크린샷과 동영상으로 볼 때 괜찮아 보입니다.&nbsp; XBOX360 대시 보드 보던 느낌도 들고 그렇습니다. 하지만&nbsp; TV에 연결할 전용 컴퓨터(TV에 물릴만한 메이저 게임을 위해서 사양도 꽤 좋아야.) - 게임 패드(유선은 무리가 있을 수 있으니 무선) 등을 생각하면 얼마나 많이 쓰게 될지 잘 모르겠습니다. '별도 콘솔을 만들지 않아도 기존 콘솔들이 하려던 거실 점령을 할 수 있을 스팀의 위엄' 정도로 생각해도 좋을 듯 싶습니다.<br><br>P.S. : 영화 등 문화상품의 디지털 유통까지 발을 넓히기 위한 과정일지도 모르겟습니다. <br><br>---<br><br>Steam Big Picture Beta Available Today<br><br>New mode of Steam designed for display on televisions; works with game controllers<br>September 10th, 2012 -- Valve announces a major update to the Steam gaming platform called Big Picture.<br><br>Steam's new Big Picture mode lets gamers access all of their favorite Steam games on a television. With the press of a button, Steam displays a new full-screen user interface optimized for readability and interaction on TV. Big Picture has been designed to be used with a traditional game controller, while also fully supporting keyboard and mouse input. &nbsp;<br><br>Steam gamers can experience Big Picture by connecting their PC or Mac to a TV, typically with a single HDMI cable. Access to the complete Steam store is included, as is the Steam Community. In addition to their complete library of Steam games, each user's cloud files, Steam Workshop content, account information and preferences will be accessible automatically in the new mode.<br>"Sega's roots are in living-room gaming." said John Clark, Vice President of Digital Distribution at Sega. "For the first time since the advent of PC games decades ago, gamers are finally going to have access to the kind of entertainment experience we've always wished they could have with our PC titles - one that's incredibly social, comfortable, and accessible. We're excited about the opportunity, and Big Picture has inspired us to bring even more of our titles to Steam in the future."<br><br>"There is nothing more satisfying than slaying thousands of orcs on your big screen. And many of the most die-hard players of Orcs Must Die 2 have always preferred playing with a game controller. Steam's Big Picture mode finally marries these two and delivers a true living room entertainment experience to players."<br><br>"We're pleased that gamers on Steam will now be able to immerse themselves in our entertainment experiences in the comfort of their living room on large screen TVs," said Steve Glickstein of Take-Two Interactive Software. "From action and adventure to sports and sims, our titles deliver big fun on big screens."<br><br>"PC gaming continues to be the leading edge of entertainment, whether it's social gaming, MMOs, graphics hardware, free-to-play, or competitive gaming," said Gabe Newell, president of Valve. "With Big Picture for Steam, we are trying to do our part to give customers and developers what they want - their games, everywhere, optimized for the environment in which they are playing."<br><br>Big Picture also includes a new web browser designed for televisions and game controllers. It is accessible from anywhere within the Big Picture UI, and even while playing Steam games on a TV. It supports Big Picture's new method of typing with a game controller, which is useful for entering URLs, filling out forms, chatting, and other functions.<br><br>For more information, including how to participate in the beta, please visit http://www.steampowered.com/bigpicture/
