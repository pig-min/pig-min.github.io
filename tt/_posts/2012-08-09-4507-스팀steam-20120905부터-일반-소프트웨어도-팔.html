자고 일어나니 이런 보도자료가 왔습니다. 안드로이드용 스팀 클라이언트에서 잠시 보여졌다고 하던 '게임 외 소프트웨어 탭'이 현실화 되었습니다. 입점은 스팀 그린라이트의 인기투표를 통해 들어가게 될거라 합니다.<br><br><br><br><p align="center"><strong>STEAM EXPANDS BEYOND GAMES</strong></p>
<p align="center"><em>Launch Set of "Software" Titles Coming Sept 5</em></p>
<p><strong>Aug 8, 2012</strong> -- Valve, creators of best-selling game franchises (such as <em>Counter-Strike</em>, <em>Half-Life</em>, <em>Left 4 Dead</em>, <em>Portal</em>, and <em>Team Fortress</em>)
 and leading technologies (such as Steam and Source), today announced 
the first set of Software titles are heading to Steam, marking a major 
expansion to the platform most commonly known as a leading destination 
for PC and Mac games.</p>
<p>The Software titles coming to Steam range from creativity to 
productivity. Many of the launch titles will take advantage of popular 
Steamworks features, such as easy installation, automatic updating, and 
the ability to save your work to your personal Steam Cloud space so your
 files may travel with you.</p>
<p>More Software titles will be added in an ongoing fashion following 
the September 5th launch, and developers will be welcome to submit 
Software titles via Steam Greenlight.</p>
<p>"The 40 million gamers frequenting Steam are interested in more than 
playing games," said Mark Richardson at Valve. "They have told us they 
would like to have more of their software on Steam, so this expansion is
 in response to those customer requests."</p>
