<p style="line-height: 150%;"><b><i><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; color: black;">SEATTLE,

announced the imminent launch of Bejeweled<sup>?</sup> 3, the first true sequel
to its beloved flagship franchise in more than six years. Featuring a wealth of
new content and triple the fun of previous installments in the series,
Bejeweled 3 elevates the </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">“<span style="color: black;">match-3</span>”<span style="color: black;"> category of puzzle games pioneered by PopCap a decade ago
to an entirely new level. Bejeweled 3 will launch on December 7, 2010 via
PopCap.com and other major portals in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific as
well as at leading retail outlets throughout North America at a suggested

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;">Beyond stunning, high-definition
graphics and mellifluous music and sound effects, Bejeweled 3 is packed with
completely new game experiences in addition to updated and expanded
re-imaginings of the four original game modes from Bejeweled 2. Four all-new
secret games including Ice Storm and Poker offer surprising new interpretations
of the Bejeweled theme, while Quest mode features eleven mini-games ?
clever hybrids of Bejeweled game-play with other classic game mechanics ?
comprising 40 total quests.</p>

<p style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">“Casual video
games have been popular going back to the 1980s, but the introduction of
Bejeweled 10 years ago launched an entire industry,” explained David
Cole, founder and president of DFC Intelligence, the oldest research firm
focused entirely on the video game market. “No other casual game comes
close to the success of Bejeweled in terms of popularity and influence. 
PopCap has been able to keep the franchise strong for 10 years because they
have focused on quality and innovation and have not flooded the market with
dozens of sequels. I fully expect Bejeweled 3 to not only be a big success in
its own right, but also ensure the Bejeweled brand continues to grow in
popularity over its next decade on the market.”</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;">“The challenge in creating a
new version of Bejeweled is to innovate and keep it fresh and exciting without
losing touch with the game-play that millions of people love. So we’re
very careful when we make changes to the core game, which is why it can take so
long!” said Jason Kapalka, co-founder and chief creative officer at
PopCap and co-creator of Bejeweled. “We've worked hard to make sure
Bejeweled 3 retains the classic appeal of the earlier games while bringing a
host of exciting new features to the table.”</p>

        <p>악마의 퍼즐 게임 비주얼드 후속작이 나온단다. 전에 비주얼드 2 공짜로 뿌릴 때 받아서 즐겁게 애용(?)하고 있는데… 이쯤 되면 캐주얼 게임이라는 게 무시 못할 물건이구나 하는 생각도 들고.</p>
