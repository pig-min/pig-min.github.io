<strong>COMMENCING TRANSMISSION…</strong>
</p>
<p>Hail people of Earth! Megadodo Publications is pleased to
announce that we are working with the interactive entertainment
development team Hothead Games to bring 
<strong>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</strong>, the
standard repository for all knowledge and wisdom, to the farthest
uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the Western Spiral
arm of the Galaxy.&nbsp; This new edition of The Guide will be
available not only on your planet but also on all nearby systems
including Alpha Centauri.</p>
<p>
<em>"We're super excited to be involved with such a legendary
creation as 
<strong>The Hitchhiker's</strong> 
<strong>Guide to the Galaxy</strong>. The quirky and hilarious
universe that Douglas Adams created became an instant classic for
so many. All the hoopiest froods here at Hothead jumped on the
chance to work on the project”,</em> commented excitable
Hothead human, Joel DeYoung.</p>
<p>Zarniwoop Vann HarlaHarlH, president of Megadodo, was
unavailable for comment as he is far too cool to add quotes to
press releases.</p>
<p>For up-to-the-Earth-minute communications on this exciting new
addition to the Guide, use your fleshy digits to prod your plastic
board of keys and visit

<u>About Hothead Games:</u>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Hothead Games, headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia, is
an emotionally secure independent developer and publisher of
groundbreaking downloadable titles. Maybe we don’t have a
“make your own ice-cream sandwich bar” like some other
game companies, but Hothead has brought to life original games such
as the scientist-approved DeathSpank and the award-winning Swarm.
Hothead is partnering with cool indie studios to bring games like
Braid to new platforms and new audiences. We also like to stand
near really ugly people so that we appear more attractive
ourselves. Check us out at
