    <font style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;" size="2"> Pig-Min did an e-mail interview with Naramura, who is leader of NIGORO. NIGORO released very big hit 'Slap Cheek' game [Rose &amp; Camellia] recently, and it became very popular all over the internet.<br><br>Naramura used 'Translation software' to make this interview, Japanese -&gt; English. I edited some of it, but you could have little bit hard time to understand partly. So please make sure about that. Thanks for your understanding.<br><br><a href="/tt/782" target="_blank">Korean version of this Interview.</a><br><br></font><div style="text-align: center; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><font size="2"><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000"  codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=8,0,0,0" id="gtembed" width="480" height="409">	<param name="allowScriptAccess" value="sameDomain" /> <param name="movie" value="http://www.gametrailers.com/remote_wrap.php?mid=22497"/> <param name="quality" value="high" /> <embed src="http://www.gametrailers.com/remote_wrap.php?mid=22497" swLiveConnect="true" name="gtembed" align="middle" allowScriptAccess="sameDomain" quality="high" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="480" height="409"></embed> </object>

<br>Even GameTrailers.com has this!<br></font></div><font style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;" size="2"><br><br><strong>1. 'Nigoro' is not very popular name in Korea, even if it's 
known for earlier work [Death Village] outside Japan. Please 
introduce yourself briefly, to Pig-Min readers.</strong><br><br>We had opened the 
game to the public making it in the hobby before. The most important work was 
"LA-MULANA", that is Windows game which looks like MSX. But we were not able to 
make the game, because our members became too busy. After that, we made NIGORO, because I want to 
continue to make the game. <br><br>We opened Flash game site to the public, for the preparation of the long period game production. We plan to make a bigger game sooner or later.<br><br><br><strong>2. 
'Slap Cheek' is the least thing, people could consider for 'Fighting 
Game'. It's very unique &amp; unusual, and very fun to play, but 
NOBODY made it until your game. How come to think about that?</strong><br><br>We were not 
accustomed to making the Flash game. To make the game that was able to play 
by more people, a lot of popular Flash games were researched.<br><br>And, we 
decided it to making a&nbsp; simple game only of hitting each other. However, We decided to look for a changeable theme, because it was not interesting in it 
alone.For slapping each other by the women, it is seen with an old drama in Japan sometimes.We got a hint 
there, and "Rose and camellia" became such a game.<br><br><br><strong>3. 'Character 
Design' seems to be influenced by Japanese old school Manga for women. 
But 'Storyline' seems to be influenced by Japanese old school manga 
for Boy. Very fun combination, as 'Escalation of&nbsp; the Enemy' 
&amp;'Hidden Boss'. Can you pick up some specific Manga,&nbsp; which you got 
influence to make this game?</strong><br style="font-weight: bold;"><br>We started making the design of "Rose and 
camellia", from the influence of the old school Manga for women style, as you guessed it.However, it 
has become like old school manga for Boy, because I am the Man &amp; I wrote the story.<br><br>I got the model from "Rose 
in Versailles(Japanese old school Manga for women)". And I got influence from "Hokuto no Ken - Fist of the North Star 
(Japanese old school manga for Boy)" for the Story.<br><br>The storyline was not too deep, because we'd like to let people playing it freely.<br><br><br><strong>4. Homepage &amp; Game have some 'English' words, but 
most of the&nbsp; messages are 'Japanese' language only. Partly 
foreigners-friendly,&nbsp; but not very friendly. Do you have any specific 
reason why? And do&nbsp; you have any future plan, to make homepage &amp; 
game 'Multilingual',&nbsp; with English &amp; even Korean? Many Korean 
people wish to play game&nbsp; with Korean language, so curious.</strong><br><br>Our team NIGORO is 3 people, and no member can translate. However, because 
a lot of foreigners have come to our site,&nbsp; so the explanation of easy 
English is put. We can prepare only the&nbsp; explanation of English, because we 
learn English at the school in Japan. We'd better make the multilingual version, by employing the translater, if our work succeeds. <br><br>People in each country explains the brief storyline local, and it works. We wish to express our gratitude to the volunteer translators.<br><br><br><strong>5. Not sure 
about Japanese market, however there are some Webgame market in USA. 
Do you have some plan to service your game with&nbsp; commercial channel in 
the future? And did you get some proposal&nbsp; from commercial game 
site?</strong><br style="font-weight: bold;"><br>Certainly, the foreigner evaluates us higher than the Japanese. First of all, NIGORO must make a lot 
of games, and became famous to make something bigger. If so, we can develop the consumer game like "Wiiware" ,"XNA" 
etc.<br><br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><strong>6. Too many people enjoyed your game, and your website went 
down&nbsp; due to traffic. Do you have some data, where all the people came from? Country &amp; Referer website, I mean.</strong><br><br>The server was moved, due to high traffic &amp; even went down.<br><br>Our site records 500000 visitors. When the game is open to the public, 50000 people visited our site that 1 day. We had not thought that such a many people came, we used just a cheap server, and sever down at then. <br><br>A lot 
of people in the sphere of Spanish came, when "Death Village"&nbsp; was opened to 
the public. NowA lot of people in the sphere of Asia have come, when "Rose 
and camellia" is opened to the public.<br><br><br><strong>7. Do you have future plan, 
to post your personal picture? Some&nbsp; people might want to see 'Who made 
it', because it's too unique and&nbsp; shocking game.</strong><br style="font-weight: bold;"><br>If we become famous 
more, we will update our photograph to the public.<br><br><br><strong>8. Please 
recommend other good Games, and&nbsp; the reason 
why.</strong><br><br>I do not play new games usually. We love retro game. We want 
to let people have the interest, what we had while playing retro games in the past.<br><br>Hydlide, Maze of Garious, Gradius, Xanadu, Relics....and more retro 
games!<br><br><br><strong>9. Did you try some Korean games, or even heard or 
experienced&nbsp; about them? If so, please share your thoughts about 
that.</strong><br><br>Sorry, we have not played Korean games. Foreign games doesn't do well in Japan. We want to play them in the future, when we have time.<br><br><br><strong>10. Please leave some message for Pig-Min readers.</strong><br><br>We wish 
to express our gratitude to a lot of foreigners for playing our game, though 
we are making the game for the Japanese. I think that there was no border in 
a fun game. However, we want to continue the game making that can amuse 
you!!<br></font><font style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;" size="2"><br><br><strong>[Rose &amp; Camellia] official page</strong> : <a href="http://nigoro.jp/game/rosecamellia/rosecamellia.php" target="_blank">Nigoro</a><br><br><br></font><font style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;" size="2"><a href="/tt/782" target="_blank">Korean version of this Interview.</a></font>
