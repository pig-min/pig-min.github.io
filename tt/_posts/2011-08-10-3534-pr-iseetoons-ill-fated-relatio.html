August. 2011) <em>Ill-Fated Relationship</em>
 by Hwang Joon Ho is a manhwa app for the iPhone about a dark romance 
between two serial killers. The app, published by iSeeToon, is now on 
sale for a special launching price of $4.99, available until September 
15th, 2011.<br />&nbsp;<br /><em>Ill-Fated Relationship</em>
 is a manhwa created specifically for the digital medium, which are 
called webtoons in Korea. They are similar to webcomics, but require the
 reader to scroll through the comic panel by panel instead of page by 
page. Webtoons are not motion comics or digital comics with a guided 
view. Each webtoon is made to be viewed just as you see it.<br />&nbsp;<br />The <em>Ill-Fated Relationship</em> app includes all 20 chapters of the story, plus some bonus material at the end.<br />&nbsp;<br />Here's what the critics have had to say about <em>Ill-Fated Relationship</em>:<br />&nbsp;<br />"The
 art style is minimalist but slightly reminiscent of the style of Frank 
Miller with Sin City and the Batman series, offering a film noir style 
that matches the darkness of the story." - 148apps.<br /><br />“Hwang’s 
style is sparse, both visually and narratively, creating an environment 
that feels both intimate and detached at the same time. While the 
limited use of color suggests a similarly subdued emotional palette, the
 lack of detail (both background and foreground) brings each emotional 
beat into sharp focus” - Manhwa Bookshelf<br /><br />"It is this feeling of 
suspense which is the strength of the App. The bare bones of the plot 
are two serial killers who start to date each other. The opportunities 
for tension are obvious: not only the tension of when each will get 
their next victim but also of whether each is assessing the other as the
 next victim ? and if so who will make the first move." - London Korean 
Links.<br /><br />iSeeToon's manager, Kim Jin Sung says, “This story 
features an unusual plot, a minimal visual style and feels more like an 
indie art film than a comic. <em>Ill-Fated Relationship</em> is too good to be missed and we're glad the critics enjoyed it. Our next release will be <em>Murder DIEary</em>. It’s like if Dexter was created as a 4-panel comic, and we hope that people enjoy it just as much.”<br /><br />There are three different video trailers for <em>Ill-Fated Relationship</em>, Side M, Side W and Side T, which should be viewed together as they have a linear storyline.<br /><br />* Trailers<br />Side M : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr_jbLTuW-8" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr_jbLTuW-8</a><br />Side W : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLkWcHzTlm0" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLkWcHzTlm0</a><br />Side T : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfVQRN2VeUk" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfVQRN2VeUk</a><br />prmac video : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDy9B9i8roc">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDy9B9i8roc</a><br /><br />Screenshot of Comics : <a href="http://iseetoon.com/en/entry/Ill-fated-relationship-How-it-looks-screenshots" target="_blank">http://iseetoon.com/en/entry/Ill-fated-relationship-How-it-looks-screenshots</a><br />Screenshot of App : <a href="http://iseetoon.com/en/entry/Ill-fated-relationship-Screenshot" target="_blank">http://iseetoon.com/en/entry/Ill-fated-relationship-Screenshot</a><br /><br />Media Contact:<br />Kim Jin Sung, mrkwang@iseeyou.co.kr<br /><br />About iSeeToon : <a href="http://iseetoon.com/" target="_blank">http://iseetoon.com</a><br />iSeeToon
