 style is sparse, both visually and narratively, creating an environment
 that feels both intimate and detached at the same time. While the 
limited use of color suggests a similarly subdued emotional palette, the
 lack of detail (both background and foreground) brings each emotional 
beat into sharp focus” - Manhwa Bookshelf<br><a href="http://www.148apps.com/news/dark-graphic-app-illfated-relationship/" target="_blank">http://www.148apps.com/news/dark-graphic-app-illfated-relationship/</a><br>"The
 videos and screenshots certainly show off a great looking style that 
will hopefully provide a pretty mature and dark experience. It’ll 
certainly make a change from the more Western offerings of the likes of 
D.C and Marvel." - 148apps.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">* Trailer</span>&nbsp; :<br>- Youtube<br>Side M : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr_jbLTuW-8" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr_jbLTuW-8</a><br>Side W : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLkWcHzTlm0" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLkWcHzTlm0</a><br>Side T : coming soon<br>- Storyberry<br>Side M : <a href="http://iseetoon.com/en/entry/Trailer-Ill-fated-relationship-Side-M" target="_blank">http://iseetoon.com/en/entry/Trailer-Ill-fated-relationship-Side-M</a><br>Side W : <a href="http://iseetoon.com/en/entry/Trailer-Ill-fated-relationship-Side-W-Storyberry-edition" target="_blank">http://iseetoon.com/en/entry/Trailer-Ill-fated-relationship-Side-W-Storyberry-edition</a><br>Side T : coming soon<br>- Vimeo :<br>Side M : <a href="http://vimeo.com/25224414" target="_blank">http://vimeo.com/25224414</a><br>Side W : <a href="http://vimeo.com/25228286" target="_blank">http://vimeo.com/25228286</a><br>Side T : coming soon<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">* Screenshot</span> :<br>Screenshot of Comics : <a href="http://iseetoon.com/en/entry/Ill-fated-relationship-How-it-looks-screenshots" target="_blank">http://iseetoon.com/en/entry/Ill-fated-relationship-How-it-looks-screenshots</a><br>Screenshot of App : <a href="http://iseetoon.com/en/entry/Ill-fated-relationship-Screenshot" target="_blank">http://iseetoon.com/en/entry/Ill-fated-relationship-Screenshot</a><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">* 1 page description about [ill-fated relationship]</span> : This page has basic information &amp; link to screenshots and trailers.<br><a href="http://iseetoon.com/en/entry/Introduction-Ill-fated-relationship-in-1-page" target="_blank">http://iseetoon.com/en/entry/Introduction-Ill-fated-relationship-in-1-page</a><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">* Media Contact</span> : Request review copy (redeem code), Interview, or another contact.<br>mrkwang@iseeyou.co.kr (Kim Jin Sung aka mrkwang)<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">* About iSeeToon</span> : <a href="http://iseetoon.com/" target="_blank">http://iseetoon.com</a><br><br>iSeeToon
