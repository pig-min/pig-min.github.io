     <font size="2">At now, Pig-Min did an Interview via e-mail with 'Jonathan Boakes' who made [Dark Fall]. <br><br><a href="http://www.pig-min.com/tt/617" target="_blank">Korean version of this interview.</a><br><br><br><div class="ttml-attachment">

</div></font><font size="2"><strong><br><br>1. You did legendary indie game work with [Dark Fall]. Made by only 1 man -&gt; Advertised through Adventure forums as GB -&gt; Made contract with 'Adventure Company' even with unmade sequel at then. It's very successful for 1 man army indie work, and many people might be curious about the story. Could you please tell some Episodes about that?<br><br></strong></font>
<div><font size="2">That's an interesting question. Looking back, to 2001, it does seem very unbelievable that such a small indie, self-made garage game could go onto to spawn a sequel (with another in pre-production) and get globally published in 6 languages, including Russian and Italian! I'd love to inspire, and comfort, future indie game developers by saying that the process and creation of an adventure was easy. It wasn't. It was a task that required great determination, patience and a little insanity. I remember working on models for Dark Fall (my first experience with both 3D modelling and game coding) until 5am each morning, and rising again at 10am. I was working, part time, as a sushi chef, throughout the production, which was exhausting work.&nbsp; Working such long hours, alone, during the dark night hours obviously influenced the actual game. Gamers have described Dark Fall as a lonely, dark and haunting experience. I often used to listen to the BBC World Service (a 24hr global radio station) throughout the night, which may explain why many of the ghostly characters encountered in Dark Fall are just voices, with no solid presence. I encountered lots of spooky moments while creating the game. The most chilling involved someone/something tapping at the window, at 2am. London is a big, busy city, so there is always the chance it was someone playing a prank, but the fact is, I couldn't see anyone outside the window, or in the street outside. Perhaps I like to think that supernatural forces were at play while creating the first of the spooky Dark Fall games. &nbsp; &nbsp; <br><br><br></font><font size="2"><strong>2. Are you satisfied with 'Adventure Company' as distibutor?<br><br></strong></font></div>
<div><font size="2">Dark Fall, and Lights Out, did appear on shelves across the US and Europe (for a very short period, in some cases), so I was satisfied with that. Beyond that, I can't think of much to say. Publishing independent games has changed in recent years, as larger publishers ignore the genre, and newer (more funky, and lively) publishers appear to take up the challenge of getting games into peoples homes. <br><br><br></font><font size="2"><strong>3. After [Dark Fall], many other Indie Adventure Games are made &amp; published. Some are self-published, and some got contract with distributor. You are pioneer of those new market. What do you think about new breeze like that?<br><br></strong></font></div>
<div><font size="2">Self publication is not only an excellent option for new developers, it pays well too. There are so many plus sides to the experience that it is hard to think why more don't give it a go. The positives include: knowing how many copies you have sold, how much the publishing costs were, who is buying your game, where did they find it and creating artwork yourself, that explains the content of the game, rather than hides it under gloss and false promise. All of the above can be hard to achieve with a commercial publisher. It is well known, and almost stereotypical, that publishers do not like to part with money, especially royalties. With self publishing, you can make as much money, honestly, as you work for. Promoting a game on adventure forums is only the start. A printed magazine, non-game website, newspaper or radio show will provide advertising space to an independent in much the same way as a commercial publisher. Obviously, an independent doesn't have the initial financial support like a commercial, so you have to pick your targets wisely. Paying for advertisements in the game magazines is pure silliness. You are competing with the big titles, with all their glitz and gloss. It is far better to focus on a publication that suits your market. For example, the recent indie adventure 'Barrow Hill ( <a href="http://www.barrow-hill.co.uk/">http://</a></font><font size="2"><a href="http://www.barrow-hill.co.uk/">www.barrow-hill.co.uk</a></font><font size="2"> )'</font><font size="2"> was advertised in science fiction fanzines, archaeology journals and magazines regarding the supernatural. The advertisement space was affordable, and got the game noticed by those who would buy it.<br><br> </font></div>
<div><font size="2">Finally, self-publication can be the start of bigger things. A game which gathers some successful reviews is bound to be more appetising to publishers. There are publishers who look to get indies on shelves, and promote them correctly. Sadly, there are not that many, which means competition is not too good. If approached by a publisher, always ask other developers (who have been published on that label) about their experience. You could save yourself a lot of heartache, misery and poverty by asking the simple question: "What has your experience been like with the publishers". Some developers may not answer, but some will. A little information is always better than no information.&nbsp; <br><br></font><font size="2"><strong><br>4. Did you have any Job contract with another Game company, due to success of [Dark Fall]?<br><br></strong></font></div>
<div><font size="2">I was approached by a few UK based multimedia outfits, and one in Venice!, who wished to create a game using their work force. These companies were producing websites, Shockwave material and menus for DVDs. They expressed a desire to move into games, after witnessing that indie games can sell well, and gather good reviews. I met some great people during that period, some of which I still work with today. Rather than join a company, and move from London, I decided to change my existing one-man XXv Productions to an umbrella organisation known as Darkling Room. There's no actual office building, or permanent team, instead I offer recording equipment, a skill base and specialist software to those who need it. In return, I get to ask difficult questions of professionals, and seek advice from those who have far more experience than I do. I couldn't have created my new game, 'The Lost Crown: a ghosthunting adventure ( <a href="http://www.thelostcrown.co.uk/">http://</a></font><font size="2"><a href="http://www.thelostcrown.co.uk/">www.thelostcrown.co.uk</a></font><font size="2"> )' &nbsp;without some guidance with scripting, animating and postproduction. No money changes hands at Darkling Room, as it suits us better to share what we have, and support each others projects. <br><br></font><font size="2"><strong><br>5. Can you tell me how you chose Horror genre?<br><br></strong></font></div>
<div><font size="2">I love it! But, strictly speaking, Dark Fall and Lights Out are not 'horror' games as such. There's no blood, gore or monsters. I prefer to think of them as supernatural thrillers, ghost stories or detective fiction. There are ghosts, but they are not dispatched with guns or actions. Whereas The Lost Crown, does involve blood, a little gore and some menacing foes. Some will be conquered using your wits and ghosthunting skills, whereas others will require you to hide, escape or exorcise them. Dark Fall, on the other hand, was much more about understanding why ghosts exist, how they are created and what they need to leave the mortal world, and travel on into spirit. <br><br></font><font size="2"><strong><br>6. Did you get some influence from Book - Movie - Music - Game, when you made [Dark Fall]?<br><br></strong></font></div>
<div><font size="2">I grew up watching lots of ghost stories, both on television and film, as well as listening to spooky stories on the radio and reading strange tales late at night. There is no one definite influence on Dark Fall, but the ghost stories from the 20th Century and British supernatural children's television would be high on a list of suspects. Time travel fantasy such as Sapphire &amp; Steel and Doctor Who would have influenced aspects such as character and location. The haunted train station and hotel, seen in Dark Fall, were inspired by a story regarding an isolated rural train line and the story Room 13 by the famous writer, M.R.James. <br><br></font><font size="2"><strong><br>7. Do you have some connection with other Indie Scene, not just Adventure Gaming? Gave &amp; Got some influence from them?<br><br></strong></font></div>
<div><font size="2">I often hear from new developers, especially independents, who like to say 'hello' and talk about their project. I wouldn't say I influence any of them, but it's good to feel that people can approach me and ask advice, should they need it. I worked quite closely with Shadow Tor Studios in the summer (Barrow Hill) and provided some voice work for MDNA's game (Time Stands Still) and Nucleosys (Scratches). <br><br></font><font size="2"><strong><br>8. Can you pick your 'Top 5 Game' list? (If you can, each list for Major / Indie. Or just whole 5 list.)<br><br></strong></font></div>
<div><font size="2">Top 5 games, yes? Both indie and none indie? Hmm, that's going to be difficult, as I've played quite a lot of games. Let me think....<br><br></font></div>
<div><font size="2">Ok, Major Commercial games would be be:<br><br></font></div>
<div><font size="2">1: Morrowind: Bloodmoon. <br>This was an expansion pack for the popular RPG. It features some brilliant puzzles, spread across a chilling landscape. The action can get a little boring, but the quests, characters and cleverness help promote this game to all-time-favourite....for now!<br><br></font></div>
<div><font size="2">2: Riven: <br>The sequel to Myst is still a favourite. The landscape is gorgeous, the music is haunting and many of the puzzles were brilliantly integrated into the world. I should mention that it does get bad points for that last puzzle. Picking up and positioning rubbish looking coloured dots is a terrible way to finish off a gaming experience. Thankfully, memories of the main game help me to ignore that aspect of the game.<br><br> </font></div>
<div><font size="2">3: Zork Nemesis: <br>Fans of the Zork games tend to criticise this instalment into the series for being too dark and miserable. I don't see that myself. It's full of sophisticated, dark humour and inventive puzzles. This was the first adventure that I played, and it stays in memory as being one of the best.<br><br> </font></div>
<div><font size="2">4: Condemned: Criminal Origins:<br>Some might think this is an odd choice, but I absolutely loved this game. It's brutal, violent, sadistic and utterly bonkers. The story shifts, twists and spirals out of control. Favourite moments include the moment when a dirty shop dummy blinked at me, and them attacked, or being hunted through an abandoned house by a masochistic and lethal killer. Scary stuff!<br><br></font></div>
<div><font size="2">5: No-one Lives Forever 2: <br>Another 'action' game. This has enough adventure elements, and story, to warrant a look-in by the adventure purists. Locations like the Indian Streets and the Siberian Military Base are beautifully constructed and feature lots of detail and gaming experimentation. I particularly liked hiding in the darkened military barracks, watching soldiers come and go, visit the toilet, chat with each other and share cigarettes. Maybe that says far too much about my personality, but I found the experience fascinating. It was a crime that a third game was not produced.</font></div>
<div><font size="2"><br>Top 5 indie games, should be easier to pinpoint: </font></div>
<div><font size="2">1: Barrow Hill:<br>This was an easy choice. Some may smirk at my choice, given that I was involved in some parts of the production, but simply put, it's one of the best indie adventures ever produced. It features logical, world based puzzles which build to a larger enigma, a spooky (but fun) atmosphere and an enlightening story regarding ancient pagan forces. It's a 80% non-linear experience and features multiple endings! What more would an adventure gamer want? I see the Korean 'Post Adventure' website gave the game 85%, so I'm not the only one who thinks Barrow Hill is a great adventure title.<br><br> </font></div>
<div><font size="2">2: The Agon series:<br>It's a same there's no sign of the new Agon chapter, as this is a brilliant adventure series. The Private Moon developers prove that independent doesn't mean 'amateur'. A few trashy, badly constructed and composed indie titles have damaged the adventure scene, which companies like Shadow Tor and Private Moon help to re-balance. These games definitely deserve to be published for global gamers to enjoy.<br><br> </font></div>
<div><font size="2">3: Scratches:<br>The atmosphere and detail in Scratches is very impressive. I particularly liked wandering around the deserted country house on a rainy Sunday afternoon, while thunder rumbled outside and something nasty stalked the hallways. The puzzles are not the best feature of the game, so great sound design and music help make this a favourite of recent years. In terms of a debut effort from the developers, Nucleosys, it's a fantastic effort.&nbsp; <br><br></font></div>
<div><font size="2">4: Rhem/Rhem2: <br>Knut Mueller's lovingly produced Myst/Riven homage is easy to like. The puzzles are brilliant brainstrainers, the locations are solid enough to feel interesting and the rusted/derelict atmosphere is positively decadent. More often than not, I felt like I was wandering around some long lost cold war installation, left to crumble into nothingness. <br><br> </font></div>
<div><font size="2">5: The Carol Reed Mysteries: <br>MDNA have, so far, created 3 adventure games. I think that's incredibly impressive. The games are enjoyable, light and unpretentious (which may be why they are lesser known). I personally like to play each new title with a group of friends, with some good wine and endless snacks! The slide-show, paint effect graphics are always pleasant, and evoke feelings of nostalgia or lost memories. Basically, they have a dreamy, existential quality which I haven't seen in other games. <br><br></font></div>
<div><font size="2"><strong><br>9. Have you ever experienced, or even heard about, Korean Games?<br><br></strong></font></div>
<div><font size="2">I don't know. Many games, by the time they arrive at European shores, have been localised and changed for the market. I play a lot of Playstation games, as well as PC, so I am bound to have experienced some Korean games. I am a big fan of Korean horror/supernatural cinema. Particular favourites include: Whispering Corridors, Into The Mirror and A Tale of Two Sisters. These films appeal to my tastes in the supernatural and feature super, intelligent stories which have left me thinking hours after the DVD has stopped spinning. <br><br><strong><br>10. Can you send some promo copy for next game, to PIG(</strong></font><font size="2"><a href="http://www.pig-min.com/"><strong>http://www.pig-min.com</strong></a><strong>) and PA(</strong><a href="http://www.postadventure.com/"><strong>http://www.postadventure.com</strong></a><strong> , Korean Adventure Zine - Forum)?<br><br></strong></font></div>
<div><font size="2">Yes. Definitely. I am more than happy to make sure that news regarding my games travels as far and as wide as possible. <br><br></font><font size="2"><strong><br>11. Please leave some message for Korean readers.<br><br></strong></font></div>
<div><font size="2">Keep making and supporting brilliant supernatural movies, and thanks for reading this interview. <br>Jonathan.<br><br><a href="http://www.pig-min.com/tt/617" target="_blank">Korean version of this interview.</a><br></font></div>
