<i>Physics Puzzle Freeware [Sand Castle - Prelude : The Faded Memories] released Soundtrack to download for free.</i></p>
<p><b><i>Seoul, South Korea - June 3rd. 2010</i></b> - Good chance to download 6 great guitar instrumental songs for Indie Game. Those songs were released through Last.fm(<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/moonyeom/SandCastle:Prelude">http://www.last.fm/music/moonyeom/SandCastle:Prelude</a>) first, and later zipped &amp; uploaded to Filefront(<a href="http://www.filefront.com/16457819/SandCastle_OST.zip/">http://www.filefront.com/16457819/SandCastle_OST.zip/</a>). </p>
<p>[Sand Castle - Prelude : The Faded Memories] is Physics Puzzle game, with Hundreds of Sands dropping. Could remind of [Auditorium] from this game, but very different style. (Ray vs Sands) 15 stages - 6 great guitar songs featured, all free to download. </p>
<p>mrkwang(admin of Pig-Min Agency) recollects about these music. "I was surprised that moonyeom(Husband of Arcshock) is not only a good programmer, but also a good guitar based musician. Late of 2009, I heard his song for the first time when he showed me prototype of [Sand Castle]. It was intro of the game, when music appeared &amp; disappeared. I got shocked, doubted if I listened wrong, and asked him to play that game intro once again. I wasn't wrong. His music was so good! After that, he even made 4 more short part for trailer only, and made them full length songs within 1 day!"</p>
<p>mrkwang adds. "I had been selling Korean Indie Music CDs abroad around 10 years, kinda professional about them. His music is great, and reminds me of '500won project(<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/500won+Project/Um+Han">http://www.last.fm/music/500won+Project/Um+Han</a>)'. It was another Internet hit classic, which I published demo 8 years ago, still people listens! Both shares something, truly indie / very lo-fi / roommade / guitar based instrumental. Just the different parts are, '500won project' was early 21st. century music &amp; moonyeom released music for his own game. Anyway I decided to release MP3s through last.fm, because music fans also have right to enjoy these great tunes!"</p>
<p>It's made by Korean Indie Game team <b>Arcshock</b>, which are Husband &amp; Wife team, truly Homemade. </p>
<p>This is Prelude / Preview of future release, which will be sold at reasonable price. And we'd appreciated any kind of feedback, including Review / Preview / Mention. We need data as many as possible to improve our future work. </p>
