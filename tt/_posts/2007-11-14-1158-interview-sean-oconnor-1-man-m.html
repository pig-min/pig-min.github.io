    <font style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;" size="2"> This time, Pig-Min did an e-mail interview with Sean O'Connor, who made [Slay] &amp; many other small but intersting games.<br><br>His games &amp; history are far different from than other Indie game industry. So it could be interesting to read his interview here. Take a big breath &amp; ready to read a long &amp; important answers.<br><br><a href="http://windowsgames.co.uk/" target="_blank">Official Homepage of Sean O'Connor</a><br><br></font><a href="/tt/1159" target="_blank"><font style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;" size="2">Korean version of this Interview</font></a><br><font style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;" size="2"><br></font><div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;" size="2"><img src="/tt/attach/1/1396524126.gif"></font><br><font style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;" size="2">Very simple, but most addictive game all over the game scene.</font></div><font style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;" size="2"><br><br><strong>1. You are very 'Unique' even in 
Indie Game scenes all over the world.&nbsp; But even if I see '<a href="http://windowsgames.co.uk/history.html" target="_blank">History of the 
Games</a>' &amp; '<a href="http://windowsgames.co.uk/cv.html" target="_blank">About Sean O'Connor</a>', it's hard to get idea who you are 
exactly, all we could know is very limited. Please introduce yourself 
&amp; your work briefly.</strong><br style="font-weight: bold;"><br>I've always been very passionate about inventing 
board games and personal computers happened at just the right time for me, when I 
was still at junior school. I found computer programming came naturally to me 
(first in Basic and then in Assembly code) and it was a great way to make games 
that I invented come alive rather than just being a passive set of rules. <br><br>I 
wrote games all through my time at school on the computers I owned: a Video 
Genie (a TRS80 compatible machine), an Acorn Electron and then an Atari ST. I 
had a couple of games published on magazines, but I kept finding that just as I 
had mastered one computer, the next generation of home computers would come out, 
and I would be back to square one. <br><br>Looking back I'm not sure why I never got a 
regular job as a computer games programmer, but hearing about the stress of 
meeting deadlines, and the hours those guys have to put in makes me thing that 
maybe I had a lucky escape!<br>&nbsp;<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><strong>2. [Slay] is released in 1995 for the 
first time, and you had more money with that game than you can earn 
with Network Managaer Job, so became Self-Employ condition until 1999. 
You live in UK, and living fair might be much higher than other 
countries, so we could assume you got real high fortune with [Slay] in 
1995! It might be real big fortune at then, as I assume. Could you 
please let us know brief information about that?</strong><br><br>I never made a 
fortune from [Slay], but it was making just a bit more than my regular job, so I 
thought it was worth the risk of quitting full time employment and having a go 
at writing similar games full time. Maybe if I lived somewhere where the cost of 
living wasn't quite so high as the UK, it would have been a really good sum of 
money though. <br>At that time I didn't have a house, wife or kids, so as long as I 
had enough money to pay the rent and buy food I was happy. I think my friends 
were very jealous, though when they had to go their 9 to 5 jobs and I stayed at 
home working on my own projects.<br><br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><strong>3. After 2001, we remember some 
'Indie Success' story, as Popcap of [Bejeweled] &amp; Introversion of 
[Darwinia]. But your Indie success [Slay] is far earlier than them. Of 
course, there were some 'Indie Success' stories even in 1990's, however 
they became 'Much Bigger' company, as ID soft of [Doom]. You were 1 man 
army from the first time, and even until now. There are some other 1 
man army (or few men army) in Indie scenes recently, but can't remember 
any of them in 1990's. Could you please let us know some Episodes about 
that, especially for 1990's?</strong><br><br>To be honest I hardly ever play any 
computer games! <br><br>I played [Wolfenstein] and then [Doom] a lot though, but John 
Carmack who wrote the 3D engine for them must have been a technical genius, and 
way beyond anything I'd attempt to do, so he absolutely deserved all the success 
he got. <br><br>I liked the simplicity of Richard Carr's DOS game [Capture The Flag], and 
that's why I wanted to do my own version of it on Windows. Maybe other people's 
games frustrate me as I keep finding myself thinking that's not the way I would 
do it if I had written it.<br><br><br><strong>4. You had made many games. Not only for 
[Slay], but also for [Conquest] - [Firefight] - ... etc., total 10 
games. But as I think, you'd rather 'Update Older Games' than 'Make New 
Games'. Your latest game was [End of Atlantis], and it's done at 2005. 
Any reason about that, to update older games again &amp; again, not 
make new games?&nbsp; ([Capture the Flag] is the latest in 2007. Sep., but 
it's still on Beta, so I didn't write about it.)</strong><br><br>A problem is 
that each game you write gets its own group of fans, who come up with new ideas 
(or find bugs!) that as the author you want to deal with. So, as you get a 
bigger collection of games, it becomes harder and harder to find free time to 
work on something brand new. <br><br>The other problem is that each new game that you 
want to do gets more and more ambitious than the last ones, so the number of 
hours needed to complete the next project can grow.<br><br>Having said that 
though, since [End Of Atlantis] I have written [Niggle] which I really wrote for my 
father in law, as it's his favourite card game. And we had just bought him a 
computer, so it was something for him to help learn about computers on. <br><br>I've also 
just finished [Capture The Flag] which I wrote to get some experience with 
isometric graphics and create a fast enough graphics engine for that so I could 
write some real-time isometric games. <br><br><br><strong>5. You are making games not 
only for Windows PC, but also for Pocket PCs / Palms / Symbian UIQ. 
These handheld machines might be very different from Laptop PC market, 
as I assume. Could you please let us know about that, as Selling Scores 
/ Buyer's Feedback / Interface / ... etc? And did you get any contract, 
to make [Slay] for NDS / PSP (or even XBLA)?</strong><br><br>I converted a few 
of my games ([Slay], [Conquest] and [The General]) onto Pocket PCs, because I found 
that programming Pocket PCs was almost identical to programming Windows, so there 
was very little work involved in porting them. <br><br>I've no experience myself in 
programming on Palms or for Symbian, and those two ports were done by friends of 
mine who really liked playing [Slay] and wanted a version on their own favourite 
handheld device.<br><br>I think the market for games on these devices is so much 
smaller than Windows PCs though, and I make nearly 90% of my sales on the Windows 
versions.<br><br>[Slay] might be a perfect game for Nintendo DSes though, but the 
overhead in learning to program on a new device would be so high that it would 
be a big risk to do conversion to them.<br><br><br><strong>6. Your games are 20$ for 1 
copy, but you do 'Bundle' a lot, as 10 Window games as 40$. It's real 
big 'Bundle', so your customers might be very interested in them. Does 
'Bundle' really works well in sales, or both of 20$ selling / 40$ 
selling works well? If you don't mind, please let us know brief idea 
about that.</strong><br><br>Naturally I try and persuade as many people as possible to 
buy the $40 bundle! But, most people just want the individual game that they've 
seen and want to buy. <br><br>I'm always happy for people to "upgrade" at a later date 
if they have bought one game and they now want to buy the whole set 
though.<br><br><br><strong>7. Do you have any future plan for New games? If so, please 
let us know about that. (Maybe [Capture the Flag]? And more?)</strong><br style="font-weight: bold;"><br>I 
really want to use the isometric graphics routines I've worked out to make some 
real-time games. <br><br>Some thoughts I've had are a massive game set in Stalingrad 
with thousands of intelligent infantry men perhaps a bit like my game [Firefight], 
or a medieval/fantasy battle game again with thousands of troops. My big problem 
though is the graphics as that's something I have no skill at whatsoever. <a href="http://reinerstileset.4players.de/englisch.htm" target="_blank">For 
[Capture The Flag], I used graphics that are freely available from this site</a>. <a href="http://reinerstileset.4players.de/englisch.htm">http://reinerstileset.4players.de/englisch.htm</a><br><br><br><strong>8. Please recommend other good Games, and explain the reason 
why.</strong><br><br>I played <a href="http://www.imitationpickles.org/galcon/index.html" target="_blank">[Galcon]</a> 
</font><font style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;" size="2"><a href="http://www.imitationpickles.org/galcon/index.html">http://www.imitationpickles.org/galcon/index.html</a> </font><font style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;" size="2">recently, 
and I thought it was brilliant but then it got quite samey after a few games. <br><br>I 
thought that <a href="http://www.liquiddragon.com/odyssey.php" target="_blank">[Odyssey Winds Of Athena]</a> <a href="http://www.liquiddragon.com/odyssey.php">http://www.liquiddragon.com/odyssey.php</a> 
was technically amazing but again the gameplay got a bit repetitive. Maybe if 
the game had been more of a strategy game where you intercede as a god to help 
your fleet to defeat the Persian fleet it would have been more my sort of 
game.<br><br><br><strong>9. Did you try some Korean games, or even heard or experienced 
about them? If so, please share your thoughts about 
that.</strong><br><br>Unfortunately no. As I play so few other games that's not 
surprising I guess though!<br><br><br><strong>10. Please leave some message for Pig-Min 
readers</strong><br><br>Thanks very much for reading this and I really hope that my games 
are your sort of thing.<br><br><br></font><font style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;" size="2"><a href="http://windowsgames.co.uk/" target="_blank">Official Homepage of Sean O'Connor</a></font><br><font style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;" size="2"><br><a href="/tt/1159" target="_blank">Korean version of this Interview</a><br></font>
