<p style="text-align: center;"><font size="3">Sweetest hero 'Sugar Cube' is doing sweet protest against 'Shut-Down policy' &amp; 'Cooling-Off Policy' by Korean government.</font></p>
<p><strong>Seoul, South Korea, Feb. 27th. 2012</strong>
 - Korean Indie team Turtle Cream released 1st. commercial game 'Sugar Cube : Bittersweet Factory', but they decided not to sell in Korean territory.</p>
<p>Turtle Cream is Korean team. But they will not sell their products in Korea. There is sad reason like this. </p>
<p>According to Korean language option in game, "Korean government has a review/screening policy for games including free ones. They had made a 'shut-down policy' and a 'cooling-off policy' for juvenile protection(?). We disagree with the Korean government which considers games as social evils such as drugs. We will not make any games in Korean until the Korean government gets rid of those
policies."</p>
<p>'Shut-down policy' is made by MOGEF, 'Ministry of Gender Equality &amp; Family'. (<a href="http://www.mogef.go.kr/index.jsp">http://www.mogef.go.kr/index.jsp)</a>&nbsp;According to 'Shut-down policy', game company must have the system that minors can't play after midnight. 'Cooling-off policy' is made by MEST, 'Ministory of Education, Science, and Technology'. (<a href="http://www.mest.go.kr/main.do">http://www.mest.go.kr/main.do</a>) According to 'Cooling-off policy', game company must have system that early-teens
can play only 4 hours a day &amp; only 2 hours per 1 play. According to these 2 policies, our sweetest hero can't be played in Korean territory legally, unless it supports 'Shut-down' &amp; 'Cooling-off'. So Turtle Cream decided not to sell their game in Korea.</p>
<p>'Sugar Cube : 
 Bittersweet Factory' is commercial version of 'Sugar Cube', which won 2010 IGF China best game. 
It is a 2D platformer game that 
presents the story of a sugar cube. The backgrounds of the game have two
 sides, namely, the front and the back. So depending on how you play, 
the environments will very often be vastly different.</p>

<p>It has 5 world themes containing unique 90 levels, 20 achievements, and 2 different endings. Plus it has SUPER CUTE looks and very sweet soundtrack. </p>
<p>You could purchase it through several digital distribution stores for Windows PC, as Desura - Indiecity - Indievania - Kawagames(Spanish) - Direct purchase through official site. </p>
