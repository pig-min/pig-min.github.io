<p align="center"><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><b>Online performance against Korean Game Rating Board, by Indie Game makers.</b></span><br>
<i>Will distribute non-game software which shows "NOT rated by GRB, so you can't play' at Sep. 17th. 2010</i></p>
<p><b><i>Seoul, South Korea, Sep. 12th. 2010</i></b> - Korean Indie Game makers team up to do online performance against GRB, Game Rating Board in Korea. </p>
<p>Early of September 2010, there happened 2 cases by Korean Game Rating Board(GRB). 1 of them is 'banning Steam from Korea' rumor, and another is 'All games must be rated including Freeware Indie Game'. 2 small RPG maker community had to close game upload forum, because they got official documents from GRB, 'to get rated or punished by law'. This rating is for every single games in that forum, over 100 games / 10,000$ rating fee. There was no choice but to close upload forum.</p>
<p>We Pig-Min Agency think it's too much, decided to do online performance 'NOT rated by GRB, so you can't play'. This performance is for spreading non-game software which shows message against GRB. This software looks like usual games, which shows opening &amp; menu. But if user clicks to play, "NOT rated by GRB, so you can't play" screen appears &amp; exit. This means, not only indie game makers are restricted, but also Players got limited.</p>
<p>This performance is started by Pig-Min Agency &amp; 2 attached teams Turtle Cream &amp; Arcshock. Got some volunteers from Korean local scene, including some Web Strategy Games / Doujin game style / Flash Game makers. Some other Indie Game creators do it as their own way, even if not joined us officially. </p>
<p>It will be done at 17th. 2010 21:00 in Korean time, uploading all Software &amp; announcements link to each other as "Size doesn't matter day" performance. We also hope to get assist from abroad, not sure how to do that. If you are interested, please contact us.</p>
