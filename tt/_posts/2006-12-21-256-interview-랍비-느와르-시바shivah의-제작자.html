</font><div style="text-align: center;"><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">Sorry. I'm Marvin Gaye, not Rabbi.<br><br><br></font></div><font size="2"><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong>1. As I know, you've lived in Korea around 7 months. How about living in Korea, as Jewish Indie Adventure Game Maker?</strong> <br><br>Yes, I lived in Korea for 7 months, but I would have hardly called myself a “Indie Adventure Game Maker” at the time. I was teaching English, and the kids left me too exhausted to make a serious go of making games. It wasn’t until I returned that I started getting serious about it. <br><br><br><strong>2. [Shivah] is very special game, as Rabbi-Noir. How come to make such one?</strong> <br><br>Well, after being in Asia for almost one year (Korea for 7 months and China for 2) and being the only Jew around, I felt very inspired to create a game with a jewish theme when I got back to New York. The noir was just a bonus. J. <br><br><br><strong>3. I read that Mel Gibson dissed [Shivah]! Is it real, or another Internet Joke? And what do you about that?</strong> <br><br>Hah. That was a joke, I think. I thought it was hysterical. <br><br><br><strong>4. I saw a rumor that you'd make an Adventure game, based on Korean Myth! Is it real? If real, what's going on with that project?</strong> <br><br>Yep! I was thinking about it while I was in Korea. I learned about the legend of Tangun and would love to make a role-playin game based on it. I haven’t done much with the idea, aside from writing some ideas in a notebook. Maybe some day. J <br><br><br><strong>5. You are making new game [The Blackwell Legacy]. Could you please explain what it is?</strong> <br><br>Sure! The game stars a woman named Rosangela Blackwell and a ghost named Joey Mallone. Against their will, they are expected to investigate supernatural mysteries and solve them. There are several games planned, and while each game stands alone there is a lengthy backstory involved, which will be revealed over time. <br><br><br><strong>6. How come to make Noir / Mystery Adventure game? And did you get some influence from some other Movie - Game - ... etc?</strong> <br><br>I played a game called “Discworld Noir” in 1999, and I fell in love with the theme. I have always loved old noir/mystery movies, with the gritty atmosphere and snappy dialog. There was just something so COOL about them. <br></font></font><strong><br><br><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">7. Can you send Pig-Min review copy &amp; contest prize, if you make next game?</font></strong><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2"> <br><br>Of course! <br><br><br><strong>8. Have you ever experienced, or even heard about, Korean games?</strong> <br><br>You mean stuff like Maple Story and Kart Rider? That’s all the kids would talk about, when I was over there. That and Starcraft, of course. ;) <br><br><br><strong>9. Can you pick other 5 games from both of Major &amp; Indie, and explain briefly why you chose them.</strong> <br><br>I have to be honest. I don’t play many games nowadays. It’s tough to choose one, let alone five. I suppose I can pick some that are the greatest influences, which are: <br><br>1 ? Discworld Noir. This game originated the clues-as-inventory concept. I didn’t invent it. J <br><br>2 ? Gabriel Knight. The detailed, researched backstory meshes SO WELL with supernatural events. I’m trying to do the same thing with Blackwell. <br><br>3 ? Aveyond. Amanda Fae’s indie RPG showed me that selling old-school games was not only feasible, but profitable as well. <br><br>4 ? Loom. Light on puzzles. Heavy on story. You can zip through it in an hour, and yet it is still considered a classic and beloved by everyone. <br><br>5 ? Reality on the Norm. I still have a soft spot for this open-source indie project. It’s been a tad dead lately, but that’s how I got my start. <br></font><strong><br><br><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">10. Please leave some message for Korean Pig-Min readers.</font></strong><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2"> <br><br>Annyeong hasayo! I have very fond memories of Korea and I am happy to know that my games are being played there. Kansa hamnida.
