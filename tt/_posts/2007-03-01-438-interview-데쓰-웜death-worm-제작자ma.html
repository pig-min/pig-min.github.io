    <font style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;" size="2"> This is e-mail interview with JTR, who made [Death Worm]. <br><br><a href="http://www.pig-min.com/tt/626" target="_blank">Korean version of this Interview.</a><br><br></font><div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;" size="2"><img src="/tt/attach/1/1237913211.png"></font></div><br><font size="2"><strong>1. Many people in Korea played [Death Worm], but don't know who made it, because [Death Worm] has only 1 official thread &amp; don't have any homepage. Could you please introduce yourself &amp; how to make this game?</strong><br><br>I'm a 20 years old (born 1986) guy from Finland, and I've been working with this "Game Maker" program for about a year. The "Game Maker" program was made by Mark Overmars.<br><br><br><strong>2. [Death Worm] is one of the best freeware game ever I experienced.&nbsp; </strong><strong>Simple but unique play style, good escalation. Could you please let me </strong><strong>know how come to make this game?</strong><br><br>I'm glad you like it. I was inspired to make this game partly by a TV-series called "Tremors," but mostly by a rumored real life killer-worm called the "Mongolian Death Worm."<br><br><br><strong>3. [Death Worm] might get several feedbacks from players, as I assume. </strong><strong>Could you please share some episodes about that?</strong><br><br>Ok. Here's a few:<br><br>-"Wow this is simply amazing, i really love this game. ether you can 'storm the front' or sneak up as an Predator. This is really good. ideas like this is just what GM is for" - loffe<br><br>-"Awesome game! Very old-school. Reminds me of Dune..." - web1992<br><br>-"Registerd at the forum just to say what an awesome game this is. Maybe it is becuase I am hardcore 'Tremors' fan, but I really enjoyed playing this." - GetAGrip<br><br>-"this games great, and realy fun, theres nothing better than being a giant worm and eating everything,love it, couldent stop playing, graphics and sounds are all good,great game JTR." - twaggy<br><br>-"one of the funniest GM made game ever i played... good job!! 9/10" - cougar_zero<br><br><br><strong> 4. Have you made another game, or do you have another upcoming </strong><br style="font-weight: bold;"><strong>project? If so, please let us know about that.</strong><br><br>I've made some small minigames. <br><br><a href="http://host-a.net/JTR/Gunslinger.exe" target="_blank">http://host-a.net/JTR/Gunslinger.exe</a><br><a href="http://host-a.net/JTR/Rat%20Trap.exe" target="_blank">http://host-a.net/JTR/Rat%20Trap.exe</a><br>(F1 is used for ingame help.)<br><br> I'll let you know when I finish a new game.<br><br><br><strong>5. What do you think about Freeware Indie Game scene? Please share </strong><strong>your thoughts.</strong><br><br>It's a great thing, of course. Very interesting to see what kind of games people make. Freeware Indie games are very popular in Finland, too.<br><br><br><strong>6. Have you played some Korean game, or experienced or even heard </strong><strong>about Korean Gaming Scene &amp; Market? If so, please share your opinion </strong><strong>about that.</strong><br style="font-weight: bold;"><br>I probably have, since I play games alot. Arcade games, too. But I rarely pay attention to what country a game was made in, so I can't remember any.<br><br><br><strong>7. Please pick other 5 Indie &amp; 5 Major games to recommend, and brief reason why. </strong><br><br>Ok. I can recommed these games:<br><br>INDIE GAMES----------------------------------------<br>"Cortex Command." <br>Shooting game for 1-4 players. It's still in development, (a single player campaign is coming) but it's already perfectly playable. I like it because it's kind of like the "Worms"-games, but this is in realtime. (No turns.)<br><a href="http://datarealms.com/" target="_blank">http://datarealms.com/</a><br><br>"Lost Labyrinth." <br>"Roguelike" game about exploring a dungeon, with Zelda-like graphics. I like this because the interface is very easy to use, and the dungeon is very different everytime. <br><a href="http://laby.toybox.de/index.php?sprache=1" target="_blank">http://laby.toybox.de/index.php?sprache=1</a><br><br>"Atomic Butcher." <br>I like this because of the theme. You play as a mutant that's sent out of a nuclear-shelter to collect meat. <br><a href="http://www.dashumankapital.net/index.php" target="_blank">http://www.dashumankapital.net/index.php</a><br><br>"Weird Worlds : Return to Infinite Space." <br>Shareware game about exploring space. This was mean't to be replayed many times. It's short and sweet, and different every time. <br><a href="http://www.shrapnelgames.com/digital_eel/Weird_worlds/1.htm" target="_blank">http://www.shrapnelgames.com/digital_eel/Weird_worlds/1.htm</a><br><br>"Emerald Miner." <br>I like this because of the nostalgic retro-style graphics and sounds.<br><a href="http://www.the-underdogs.info/game.php?id=4270" target="_blank">http://www.the-underdogs.info/game.php?id=4270</a><br><br>MAJOR GAMES----------------------------------------<br>"Morrowind. (Game of the Year-edition)" <br>I like these kinds of freeform RPG's. I play it on Xbox.<br><br>"Fallout 2" <br>Another freeform RPG with a post-nuclear theme.<br><br>"Silent Hill 1-3" <br>Great horror games.<br><br>"Red Dead Revolver." <br>the Best Wild West game on the consoles, in my opinion.<br><br>Can't think of a fifth major game, but "Donald in Maui Mallard" (on the Sega Genesis/Megadrive) is one of my favourite games of all times.<br>------------------------------------------------<br><br><br><strong>8. Please leave some message for Pig-Min interview readers.</strong><br><br>My message to the readers: Thanks everybody for checking this interview and good luck in your games! -JTR<br><br><br></font><font style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;" size="2"><a href="http://www.pig-min.com/tt/626" target="_blank">Korean version of this Interview.</a></font>
