팝캡(Popcap)에서 바로 그 제휴에 대한 보도자료가 나왔습니다. 이걸 보니까 조금은, 왜 어떻게 이런 상황이 되었는지에 대해 이해가 갑니다. 전문을 카피해 아래 올려봅니다.<br><br><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center; line-height: 150%;" align="center"><b><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%;">PopCap Games Partners With NCsoft To
Offer “PopCap<sup>?</sup> World”</span></b></p>

<br>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center; line-height: 150%;" align="center"><b><i><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%;">PopCap’s first ever online
multiplayer social game service will debut in Korea later this year</span></i></b></p>

<br>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><b><i>Tuesday 14<sup>th</sup>
September 2010</i> -</b> PopCap Games, worldwide leader in casual games, today
announced a deal with NCsoft, leading provider of online &amp; MMO games to
bring PopCap's first online multiplayer social game service to Korea later this
year.<br>

</p>The new platform, <b>PopCap<sup>?</sup>
World</b>, is the first product to be developed and released by PopCap's
Shanghai game studio and marks a major milestone for the company in terms of
its global online and social strategies.

<br>

<br><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;">PopCap World, operated by NCsoft,
will launch with 13 of PopCap’s award-winning games such as <em>Bejeweled<sup>?</sup></em>,
<em>Plants vs. Zombies<sup>™</sup></em> and <em>Zuma<sup>?</sup></em> as well as an
all-new multiplayer game, <em>Super Zuma<sup>™</sup></em>, built exclusively for
Korean players. All of the games are free to play, with optional, premium paid
elements to be added later.</p>James Gwertzman, PopCap's Vice
President for Asia/Pacific, said: 

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><i>“When Disneyland first opened,
it revolutionized the amusement park industry and ushered in the era of the
modern theme park. In the same way, we believe PopCap World has the potential
to redefine casual games in Korea and beyond by offering players the most
immersive PopCap experience yet. </i></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;"><i>“Our announcement today is just
the beginning. We are very excited about our partnership with NCsoft ? their
formidable presence in the online market combined with PopCap’s leadership in
the casual and social spaces makes for an interesting recipe that we look
forward to serving up to players in Korea ? and beyond.”</i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;">PopCap - and flagship franchise, <em>Bejeweled</em>
- is widely regarded as a founding father of the casual games industry. Over
the past 10 years, the company has solidified its reputation as a games pioneer
by innovating new games genres exemplified in games such as the
BAFTA-nominated, <em>Plants vs. Zombies</em>. PopCap is one of the few game
developers/publishers that has successfully adapted itself to an
ever-increasing variety of new gaming platforms and technologies. </p>Most recently, the company has
gained notoriety for its success in the mobile and social spaces: it’s first iPhone
game, Bejeweled 2, has been in the top 20 apps since it’s July 2008 launch;
while the company’s first social game, Bejeweled Blitz, launched in December
2008, is one of the top games on Facebook with over 4 million daily active
users (DAU). As PopCap prepares to launch its second social game, Zuma Blitz,
on Facebook later this month, there is palpable excitement surrounding projects
on both sides of the world ? and how these might eventually inform each other.

<br>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;">Mr. Whang, NCsoft’s Vice President
for Web Business Center, said <i>“We are thrilled to be
collaborating with PopCap Games on this new project. PopCap is famous not only
for the high quality of their games ? they are a very talented developer ? but
also for appealing to an extremely wide audience. We look forward to a
successful launch, and to opening up this new world of fun to both our existing
Korean users, as well as a whole new audience for whom this may well be their
first online game.”</i></p>
