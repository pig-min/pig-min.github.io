    <font style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;" size="2"> This is the Interview with the Producer - Managing Director 'Chanon' at Viquasoft, which made [Tommy and the Magical Words]. You could find English version below, so go down to find it! Thanks!<br><br>Viqua Games : <a href="http://www.viquagames.com/" target="_blank">http://www.viquagames.com/</a><br><br><a href="http://www.pig-min.com/tt/624" target="_blank">Korean version of this Interview.</a><br><br><br></font><div style="text-align: center; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><font size="2"><img src="/tt/attach/1/1106161871.jpg"><br><br></font></div><font style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;" size="2"><br></font><div><font size="2"><strong>1. Did you choice some 'Target Player' for 
Word Games? If so, how did you choice them?<br><br></strong></font></div>
<div> </div>
<div><font size="2">We saw that there were some word games such as 
Bookworm that were doing very well. At the same time, there weren't that many 
high quality word games in the market, so we felt we could create something to 
fill that gap.<br><br><br></font></div>
<div> </div>
<div><font size="2"><strong>2. We could call it 'Word Game' as 'Another 
Method of Education' or 'Edu-tainment'. Did you expect something like that, when 
you make &amp; release 'Word Game'?<br><br></strong></font></div>
<div> </div>
<div><font size="2">Yes, we felt our game would be very good as an 
educational game for learning English. There have been many customers sending 
emails telling us that our game has helped their children to learn English .. 
which of course makes us feel very proud. Also our game has been bought 
by schools in the US.<br><br><br></font></div>
<div> </div>
<div><font size="2"><strong>3. There might be some 'positive feedback' 
about your works, as 'Word Game'. And you might feel very good about that. Could 
you please let us know some episodes about that briefly?<br><br></strong></font></div>
<div> </div>
<div><font size="2">Yes, as I said above, some customers have thanked us 
for helping their children learn English, which makes us feel very happy. 
Another one which I remember is from a father saying that he'd been playing the 
game their children and dinner time came and the children were so engrossed with 
the game they didn't want to come for dinner!<br><br><br></font></div>
<div> </div>
<div><font size="2"><strong>4. Player must make some words, with any 
alphabet tiles appeared. It seems to be done randomly, but there might be some 
algorithm, as I assume. Could you please let me know what kind of algorithm to 
make it happen?<br><br></strong></font></div>
<div> </div>
<div><font size="2">I can't remember the exact algorithm, but basically 
we try to ensure that there are at least 2-3 vowels and that there is no 3 
occurences of a single character.<br><br><br></font></div>
<div> </div>
<div><font size="2"><strong>5. You can't use all the words in the English 
culture, and you might have some basis to choice 'What words use &amp; What 
words don't use'. Could you please let us know, how you decided (or choiced or 
made) 'Dictionary' of the game?<br><br></strong></font></div>
<div> </div>
<div><font size="2">The dictionary is based on ENABLE2K word list which 
you can find on the internet.<br><br><br></font></div>
<div> </div>
<div><font size="2"><strong>6. [Tommy and the Magical Words] has 'meaning 
window' of the made words. As I recall, only few word games show 'meaning' for 
the made words. Could you please let me know how come to make such window 
display? And does it show every word, or only chosen ones? If only chosen ones, 
maybe developer might choice which words to show the meaning &amp; which not. 
Could you please let me know how you decided?<br><br></strong></font></div>
<div> </div>
<div><font size="2">We use WordNet definition database as the basis for 
the meanings. The game shows the meaning for all words that are not "dirty 
words" that are more than 3 in length. Also some words might exist in the word 
list but not in the definition database, so those words won't have 
meanings.<br><br><br></font></div>
<div> </div>
<div><font size="2"><strong>7. Could you leave some advise something, if 
somebody wants to make 'Word Game' with non-English, as Korean or Japanese or 
Chinese?<br><br> </strong></font></div>
<div> </div>
<div><font size="2">First you will need to look at the language and see 
what kinds of game designs you can come up with for the language. Some languages 
might not work with some designs. Then you may </font><font size="2">need a list of words that are easy to parse. For English we used ENABLE2K 
which was a text file formatted as word word per line.<br><br></font></div>
<div> </div>
<div><font size="2"><strong><br>8. Please recommend us 5 other good games?<br><br> 
</strong></font></div>
<div> </div>
<div><font size="2">Here are some of our favorites:</font></div>
<div> </div>
<div><font size="2">1. Luck Charm Deluxe</font></div>
<div><font size="2">2. Inca Quest</font></div>
<div><font size="2">3. Pizza Frenzy</font></div>
<div><font size="2">4. Bookworm Adventures</font></div>
<div><font size="2">5. Bookworm<br><br><br></font></div>
<div> </div>
<div><font size="2"><strong>9. Have you played some Korean game, or 
experienced or even heard about Korean Gaming Scene &amp; Market? If so, please 
share your opinion about that.<br><br></strong></font></div>
<div> </div>
<div><font size="2">I played Lineage 2 for a few months. Korean game 
industry looks extremely strong compared to ours (Thailand).<br><br><br></font></div>
<div> </div>
<div><font size="2"><strong>10. Please leave some message for Pig-MIn 
Interview Readers, especially for whom are interested in 'Word Games'.<br><br>
