<p style="text-align: center;">With high praise tweet by Phil Spencer.</p>

<p><strong>Seoul, South Korea, Sep. 19th. 2014</strong>  - Korean indie team Turtle Cream release '6180 the moon' for Steam.</p>

<p> '6180 the moon' is very unique platformer.  The top and bottom of the
 screen are connected so that you can jump over the screen and come out 
of the bottom, and vice versa. Plus it has astonishing ambient style soundtrack, which every gamer will adore. That's why it's picked by 
Experimental Gameplay Workshop at GDC 2013. </p>

<p>Originally, '6180 the moon' (PC) released at 9th. Mar. 2013 via Indie Royale Debut Bundle. At then, [6180 the moon] is made by Game Maker. Turtle Cream decided to remake it by Unity, while they tried to port to several different platform as Nintendo Wii U &amp; iOS. Steam release is newly remade version by Unity, basically same but better. Here's Steam page for '6180 the Moon'. <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/299660/">http://store.steampowered.com/app/299660/</a></p>
