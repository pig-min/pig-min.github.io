<p><strong>* About Game</strong></p>

<p>'6180 the moon' is a platformer game with a unique mechanic. It 
offers a fresh, unseen game play style by connecting the top and bottom 
of the screen. This allows in a mechanic with delightfully long jumps 
and no fear of "slipping" to death. In addition to the unique gameplay, 
'6180 the moon' delivers a unique storyline. The Sun has gone. The Moon 
sets off on a journey to find the Sun. Along the journey will be 
hazardous courses and deep realizations.  </p>

<p>'6180 the moon' is 2nd. commercial game by Turtle Cream. Their 1st. 
commercial game was Sweetest Platformer, 'Sugar Cube: Bittersweet 
Factory' at Steam.</p>

<p>This one surprised me honestly since it's not a genre I particularly enjoy, but the unique screen-wrap mechanic and excellent music are enchanting. - Total Biscuit<br>
